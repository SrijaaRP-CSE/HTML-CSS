        These are some of the <b> popular programming languages</b> used 
        
        by software proffessionals accross the world.

        A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.[1] Most programming languages are text-based formal languages, but they may also be graphical. They are a kind of computer language.

        The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), which are usually defined by a formal language. Some languages are defined by a specification document (for example, the C programming language is specified by an ISO Standard) while other languages (such as Perl) have a dominant implementation that is treated as a reference. Some languages have both, with the basic language defined by a standard and extensions taken from the dominant implementation being common.

        Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages.

    <h1>Computer languages vs programming languages</h1>

    <p>
        The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language.[2] However, the usage 
        of both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes
        programming languages as a subset of computer languages.[3] Similarly, languages used in computing that have a
        different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages. For instance, markup 
        languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used for 
        programming.[4] One way of classifying computer languages is by the computations they are capable of expressing, 
        as described by the theory of computation. The majority of practical programming languages are Turing complete,[5] 
        and all Turing complete languages can implement the same set of algorithms. ANSI/ISO SQL-92 and Charity are examples
        of languages that are not Turing complete, yet are often called programming languages.[6][7] However, some authors
        restrict the term "programming language" to Turing complete languages.[1][8]
        Another usage regards programming languages as theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines and 
        computer languages as the subset thereof that runs on physical computers, which have finite hardware resources.[9] 
        John C. Reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just as much programming languages as are the 
        languages intended for execution. He also argues that textual and even graphical input formats that affect the behavior
         of a computer are programming languages, despite the fact they are commonly not Turing-complete, and remarks that 
         ignorance of programming language concepts is the reason for many flaws in input formats.[10]
